# Drug-Target Interaction Prediction using KNN Algorithm
A project as a part of Pattern Classification course. (Oct 2021 - Nov 2021)
- Developed model to predict if a significant correlation exists between various drugs and target proteins (‘KIBA’ score) using Python and predicted KIBA score using regression.
- Learned about fundamentals of Machine Learning and WEKA software.
